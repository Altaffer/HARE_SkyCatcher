Follow this checklist to succeed

[] Open this checklist in a new window for continued refrence

[] Start up basestation software (./basstation) and look for "beep boop 1337 hax" 
	This nonsense means yoursystem is setup and ready for connecting to the jetson
	You will be prompted to enter a password for the jetson, its "Astro"

[] Figure out what the ssd has enumerated as
	cd /media/jetson
	It should be "hareflightdisk00X", cd into the disk with the highest "X" 
	There should be some bag files in there 

[] Navigate and update the topic_check.py
	change RECORDING_LOCATION to the correct path as noted earlier

[] Check flightdata.sh for these nodes 
	cat flightdata.sh (prints the file to your terminal)
	camera node
	ublox node (zed f9p)
	dji node
	micasense

[] Cool now you are almost ready to go
[] You need to run two scripts, I use tmux and split the terminal, one for each script

[] ./flightdata.sh

[] python3 topic_check.py
	wait for "go for flight"

[] GO FLY


[] ./killfdata.sh

[] Awesome check the bag for thermal camera data


TROUBLESHOOTING


[] IF THE FLIR FELL OFF (lost data at some point)
	fly again
	use tmux to open a new terminal
	dmesg --follow
		this will show you major changes and errors, flir falling off will show up here


[] SSH back to the jetson
	./ssh_to_jetson.sh

[] Jetson not connecting over wifi
	plug into ftdi
	screen /dev/ttyUSB0 115200
	ip a (it should be wlan0 inet 10.42.0.XXX/24)
		if its not that ip or a very similar ip use the ip reset script on wlan0
	sudo nmcli con delete hare_hotspot
	sudo nmcli dev wifi connect hare_hotspot password "hare-field"

	you should be good to ssh again
